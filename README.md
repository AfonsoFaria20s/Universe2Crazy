# Universe2Crazy 🌌

Universe2Crazy is a creative Java application that allows users to create, manage, and visualize interactive "universes" through a graphical interface and a built-in command-line console. Inspired by retro-style tools and minimalist design, Universe2Crazy brings structure and playfulness to particle simulation and UI experimentation.

## Features

- 🖥️ **Custom Console Interface** – Type commands to control your universe environment.
- 🪐 **Create Universes** – Instantiate new universe frames dynamically.
- 🗂️ **List Universes** – View all currently active universes.
- ✏️ **Rename Universes** – Update the name and title of any universe.
- 🧱 **Modular Architecture** – Easy to extend with new commands or universe behavior.

## Getting Started
